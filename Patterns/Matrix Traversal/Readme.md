Matrix Traversal Pattern Learnings -

1) Problems solved using BFS and DFS graph methods.
2) BFS problems solved using queue with majorly while(!q.isEmpty()) condition
3) For both methods, directions array used to check for neighbouring cell elements.
   int[][] directions = {
     {-1,0}, // left
     {1,0}, // right
     {0,-1}, // up
     {0,1} // down
   };
